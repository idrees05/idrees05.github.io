## Project Structure

The project is structured into several sections, each portraying different aspects of my profile:

1. **Header Section**: Contains my name and a sub-heading indicating my career aspiration.
2. **Icon Section**: Contains icons linking to my professional profiles and resume.
3. **Profile Section**: Tells my story and showcases a profile picture.
4. **Project Section**: Displays some of the projects I've worked on.
5. **Footer**: Contains copyright information.

## Challenges Faced

### Designing the Layout

The initial challenge was designing a layout that is visually appealing and conveys information in a structured and concise manner.

### Footer Positioning

Positioning the footer at the bottom of the page without any whitespace underneath was a significant challenge. Initially, the footer would either float above the bottom of the page, leaving whitespace underneath, or it would remain fixed and visible as the user scrolled.

### Icon Transition

Creating a hover effect for the icons where the icon color changes and a background circle appears was another challenge faced. It required careful CSS styling and experimentation.

### Scrollbar Styling

Customizing the scrollbar to align with the overall theme of the portfolio while ensuring it remained functional across different screen sizes.

## Solutions

1. **Designing the Layout**: Through iterative design enhancements and feedback, the layout was refined to meet the desired look and feel.
2. **Footer Positioning**: The issue was resolved by using a combination of CSS properties `position: relative;` on a new wrapping div and `position: sticky;` on the footer.
3. **Icon Transition**: By setting a transition property and adjusting the filter property on hover, the desired effect was achieved.
4. **Scrollbar Styling**: Utilized webkit scrollbar styling to achieve a custom scrollbar design.
